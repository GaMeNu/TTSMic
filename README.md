## :sparkles: Features:
- Simple TTS through your microphone
- Change TTS settings with commands (e.g. speed, volume, voice)
- File playing with basic controls (play, stop, pause, resume)
- Asynchronous audio playback, so you can hear what you're playing! (Don't laugh. This took SO LONG to figure out.)

## :arrow_down: Installation:

### VB-Audio Cable
You will need the VB-Audio Cable program first.

You will download a zip within which there will be 2 exe files.
Make sure to install the version that fits your OS!

(x64 for 64bit OS, otherwise the normal install. Check the README file for more info)

Download link:
https://vb-audio.com/Cable/

### TTSMic
After installing the Cable program, download the latest TTSMic release from the Releases tab (to the right of the main page of this repository)

And that's it!

## :fast_forward: Future plans:
- Reworking the structure of the program (mostly splitting the file into more files
- Soundboard
- Better file playback controls and real time playback morphing (pitch, speed, etc.)
- Custom Audio library, probably based on [mjbrusso's AudioPlayer library](https://github.com/mjbrusso/AudioPlayer) (And PyGame mixer? idk)
- GUI with PyGame
