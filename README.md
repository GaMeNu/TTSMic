## :sparkles: Features:
- Simple TTS through your microphone
- Change TTS settings with commands (e.g. speed, volume, voice)
- File playing with basic controls (play, stop, pause, resume)
- Asynchronous audio playback, so you can hear what you're playing! (Don't laugh. This took SO LONG to figure out.)
